# Project of the Digital Logic Design course

VHDL project for the Digital Logic Design course.
The aim was to implement a Finite State Machine able to [equalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization) a black and white image with 256 levels to increase the global contrast of the image. For more information read the [report](https://github.com/lorecampa/ProjectDigitalLogicDesign/blob/main/deliverables/report.pdf).
